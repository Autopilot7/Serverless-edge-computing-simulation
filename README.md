# Digital Twin Simulation with hierarchical serverless functions

## Description

This repository contains a digital twin simulation that uses hierarchical serverless functions to simulate the behavior of a system. The simulation is designed to demonstrate how serverless functions can be used to model complex systems in a scalable and efficient manner.

## Installation

- Requirements:
  - Node.js (version 14 or higher)
  - npm (Node package manager)

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

- Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd digital-twin-simulation
```

- Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

- Start the simulation:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the simulation.
- You can interact with the simulation through the web interface, which allows you to modify parameters and observe the behavior of the system in real-time.
